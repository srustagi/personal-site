My piece of the internet.

As a non-Roski student with an ardor for design, I was concerned that finding opportunities to get involved in the design community and improve my craft would prove difficult. However, after attending just one AIGA info session, I was knew I had found a community tailored to my needs and goals. To me, AIGA USC is a <WORD> community for graphic designers, and I want to expand the resources and opportunities we provide our members. Two such examples are creating exhibitions for members to showcase our work, as well as a market-style (IS THERE A NAME FOR THIS, OPEN STUDIO, SOMETHING, ETC? LIKE THE TIME THERE WAS THAT THING AT MITCHELL PARK LIBRARY) event where we can sell our projects.

Other than ideas for improvements, I'll be bringing my trademark sense of humor, a great attitude, and a plethora of experience! In my time as Publicity Coordinator for student council, I produced all the graphics for all class council and many school-wide events. I was also a Layout Designer for our school's yearbook team for two years. In this position, I not only honed my design skills, but learned key management skills such as working with strict deadlines, and serving as a team lead on collaborative projects. 

By bringing my years of experience in both design and leadership to the table, I believe I will be a good fit for the Director of Graphics position.
